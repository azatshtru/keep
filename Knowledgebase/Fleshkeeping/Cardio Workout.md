# manually finding your pulse
It is not always possible to have a fit it or an Apple Watch or a BPM monitor, but that shouldn't be an excuse for doing an unmeasured workout.
> Always measure your workouts

1. Lightly press your index, second and third fingertips on the palm side of the opposite wrist below the base of the thumb.
2. Count the beats for 15 seconds, then multiply by four to get your heart rate in beats per minute.
# target heart rate
target maximum heart rate is calculated by subtracting your age from 220

For cardiovascular workout, set the heart rate goal to be 60% to 80% of the maximum heart rate
# start slow and maintain
Always walk for 2-5 minutes before heavy cardio to let the body adjust and level the heart rate

slowly increase cardio activity until you reach 60% to 80% of the target maximum heart rate instead of directly going for the highest intensity

Once you reach the range, maintain the heart rate for as long as possible, a good ideal range is 20-30 minutes each day, but if you can't then less is fine when you're starting out.

If running on the same speed gets boring and monotonous, then switch to a varying high and low intensity workout
