1. 15 minute void sessions
2. Nootropics: Some lion mane mushroom + caffeine + 200mg l theanine
3. while reading, learning, etc. listen to binaural theta 4Hz beats for straight focus
4. snap your fingers when you realize you are distracted, so that it becomes a sort of snap off point
5. memory palace: associate smells, places, people, tastes, etc. with something, so that whenever you forget it later, the particular smell reminds you of it. For example, when learning Japanese, chew cardamom, so that later if you forget japanese and chew cardamom, your brain instantly remembers the stuff.
6. train your brain to mute distractions, play cafe sounds while working, so that the brain learns to auto mute whenever you are in an actual cafe, (not really sure about this one).

> Brain is not lazy, its efficient, treat it like a weapon.

Read long books, not in one pass, but multiple passes, each time learning more of the topic and gaining deeper insight, it is okay to not know everything on the first pass. **Repetition is KEY**.

Learn everything by recalling multiple times over a period of time. every two 2 days, then every 4 days, then 8 days, 16 days, 32 days, 64 days and by the 128th day, i.e. the 7th recall, you will remember it completely.

7 recalls, 7 repetitions, be one with mastery

> Instead of perfection, achieve consistency
