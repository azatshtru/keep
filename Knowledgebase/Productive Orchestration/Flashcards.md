Make flashcards about topics you want to remember:   
Divide a box into 7 sections, each representing a power of two. The box can be digital.   
The cards in the first section should be studied daily, while the ones in the second section should be studied every second day, the ones in the third section should be studied every fourth day, ones in the fifth every eighth day and so on.   
Put all the flashcards in the first section of the box in the beginning.   
Study the cards, if you can accurately remember the answer, move the card to the next section in the box. If you cannot get the answer right, move the card to the first section.   
If the card reach the last section of the box and you can easily tell the answer while studying, then you have remembered the thing and the card has served its purpose.
