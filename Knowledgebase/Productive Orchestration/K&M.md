A framework for Knowledge and Mastery   
Acquiring mastery is a feat demanded by few, achieved by fewer.   
### Knowledgebases   
Knowledgebases are constructs of complete interconnected knowledge and documented mastery. All other constructs in this system have the same goal: to advance the knowledgebase.   
### Captures   
Captures are quick jot-downs of uncategorized online links, PDFs, vague uncategorized tasks or quick ideas and fleeting notes that come to mind.   
An hour or two of the day can be taken out to categorize these captures, filter out and streamline the ideas and connect or turn them into either Projects, Actions or Resources.   
### Projects   
Projects are any document with descriptions of an ongoing goal, and collections of tasks and subtasks to finish that goal before a loosely defined due-date.   
### Areas   
Areas are any document containing descriptions of domains of life without due-dates that are performed daily. These are done for persistence or continuous development of body and mind. For example: exercising daily, reading a book for pleasure, or doing meditation.   
### Resources   
Resources are PDFs, websites, videos, books, articles etc. that are well-categorized and are ready for analysis.   
The effects and insights from projects, areas and resources help in contributing to the knowledgebase. For example, reading a book will lead to writing a summary and insight from the book which may or may not be immediately connected to already documented knowledge in the Knowledgebase.   
### Archive   
Archive is for any project, area or resource that is no longer relevant, for example a project past its due-date, an area of life that isn't useful anymore, a project that has lost interest, any prior knowledge that seems uneventful and fruitless to categorize, a resource that doesn't need analysis anymore, etc.
