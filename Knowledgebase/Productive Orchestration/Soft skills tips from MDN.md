# Utilize social media to find a community
- Learn to give back as well as take; web developers who reciprocate are much more likely to build strong relationships and keep getting help.
- When you find a useful answer, write about it. For example, blog about it or share it on a social network. Not only will the process of writing clarify the concepts to you, but you'll also get validation and/or feedback from the community. It could also help you to start making a name for yourself in the industry.

# create a portfolio
- A nicely-presented landing page to summarize everything.
- A list of websites, apps, and other relevant products that you've worked on. For each one, include a title, thumbnail image, and a description of the project and what you did on it. If you want to say quite a lot about the projects, create a separate page about each one! Include a list of the technologies used to build the project and a link to the source code if you are able to (not all source is open).
- Links to the source code and live demos of your own personal projects and experiments. Each project should include a description of what it does and the technologies used to build it.
- Links to blog posts, writing samples, conference talks, and any other assets you think might help show off your skills.
- A list of contributions you've made to open source projects, stating what the contribution was, how it improved the project, and what technologies were involved. You should include links to the actual changes you made (source code, published documentation, etc.), and a link to the changelog (for example, the GitHub pull request) that proves you did the work.
