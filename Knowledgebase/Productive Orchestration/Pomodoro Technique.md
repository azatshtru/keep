Work for 25 minutes with great focus, uninterrupted, then take a 5 minute break.
This 25/5 cycle is called one pomodoro. After every 4 pomodoros, take a 15-30 minute long break.

Break down larger tasks into smaller chunks and finish them in 25 minute intervals, coagulate miniscule tasks into 25 minute larger tasks. Finish each of the 25 minutes divided down or coagulated up tasks in one pomodoro. This turns the abstract idea of time required to complete a mammoth task into manageable and concrete idea of a pomodoro.

It helps us do things that look too big to get started upon and also helps us track tasks while combating distractions all at once. It combats cognitive paralysis. [[Cognitive Biases]]

Overtime you develop this smug satisfaction of staying productive and your brain develops nerve endings to filter out distractions and focus.
# Tips to maximize productivity with pomodoro
1. Plan overflow pomodoros. It is impossible to assess perfectly whether you can finish a task in one pomodoro, therefore instead of planning the workday with filled pomodoros, leave 2-3 pomodoros empty for tasks that might overflow from other pomodors that day.
2. If you face distractions that require you to pause the current pomodoro, take a deep breath, and a 5 minute break, then start a new pomodoro.
3. Do not use screens during your breaks, go for a walk, make a quick sandwich, meditate, or exercise.
# Alternative optimal lengths for Pomodoros
For creative work like coding, art, music production etc. that requires the flow state, instead of the 25/5 pomodoro setup, you can opt for 52/17 to help you reach that flow state without disruptions, or if you need longer flow, you can go with 112/26.

If there is a lot of cognitive load just to get started, then the time can even be reduced, opt for 15/5, or 10/5 if there is some task so big and boring and you are certain your brain would feel that 25 minutes are still longer.
