While making notes, learn before writing, be it on paper or keyboard. 
### 4 step program to make effective notes, without wasting time
1. pick a topic 
2. learn it 
	1. watch or read the entire thing before making notes, resist the temptation to make notes in between, take time to understand the topic, making notes reactively makes you lose focus. 
	2. whenever a subtopic arrives, instead of writing the entire content of the subtopic, write just the name, and some optional description of what the subtopic explains.
	3. Take time to understand the material, even if it feels hopeless, use the blackbox technique if you can, but take time, a lot of it (if required). 
3. after understanding once, make notes. 
	1. if math/diagrammatically heavy, then make them on paper before digitizing. 
	2. These are the unprocessed notes, where you write to retain, and to help explain yourself clearly. 
	3. rewatch or reread the material, but not to understand, simply to verify, understanding shall be done in the previous learning step.
	4. decide while making notes, what is to be remembered and what is primary objective of understanding. 
4. depending on the material, decide flashcards, weekly review, atomic notes, etc. 
5. Bonus step: revisit notes after a while, maybe in a weekly review and make them smaller, filter them out, organize them, tag them, link to existing knowlege.
