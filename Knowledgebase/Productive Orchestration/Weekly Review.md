### Few tips on designing and executing these tables
1. Make sure to not have more than 2 major goals per day when designing the weekly schedule.
2. During each weekly review, make a spreadsheet and track how much of these tasks were you able to finish satisfactorily during the week, what were the roadblocks, what were the Acuties (things you did right), and what are the actions you can take next week to be more productive next week.
3. Never spend more than 3-*ish* hours on a single task.
4. Do not spend more than 1 hour on the weekly review and schedule weekly review on the same time on the same day of the week.
5. During the analysis of key results, see if they are helping the overall goals you have in mind, or they are helping you improve in some specific area in life.
6. Make sure to reach inbox zero and assign priorities, due dates, labels and contexts to the captured tasks throughout the week.
### Few tips for notes and resources
1. Make sure to free the mind of any thoughts gathered throughout the week to make space for new ones in the next week, assign proper tags to fleeting ideas and notes and schedule time to turn those ideas into proper permanent reviewed notes.
2. Make sure to go through each resource (links, books, videos, etc.) gathered throughout the week, assign tags to them and delete if something is no longer necessary, or manage resources into proper folders connected to the required project, so that whenever you are working on that project, you can immediately find the required resource.
### Declutter
During weekly review, clear workspace, delete, manage, declutter screenshots, temporary files, photos, PDFs that were not managed throughout the week.
