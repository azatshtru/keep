Objectives are the things we need to accomplish.
Key results are the results, improvements, changes we expect to see from finishing a particular objective.

To implement, create a table:

| Objective | KR1 | KR2 | KR3 |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- |
|           |     |     |     |
define objectives and define 3-5 key results you expect to see, then track if the results were achieved using a table like above.
