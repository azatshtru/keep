> From Todoist's student guide:   

- **Resources**: Add this section at the top of a project and keep important documents and online resources a click away. For instance, under this section you can add a task that links to your syllabus, course website, professor’s contact details, online test resources, and more.   
- **Exam Dates**: Never get caught off guard by an exam. Create a section to input all your key exam dates including quizzes, midterms, and finals.   
- **Assignment and Project Deadlines**: Keep track of deadlines by adding due dates for upcoming assignments and projects to a dedicated section.   
- **Readings**: Add readings to your course project in their own section. Add readings at the start of the semester, or week to week.   
- **Lecture Tasks**: For all other catch-all and ongoing tasks, add them to a general “Lecture Tasks” section to keep your project clutter free and easy to navigate.   
   
For the semester, add a project.   
For each course, add a subproject   
For each course, add:   
1. Course Guidelines (syllabus, guidelines)   
2. Exam Dates as due-Tasks   
3. Reading resources   
4. Weekwise notes (week 1, week 2, week 3, ...) each weekwise note will have the actual note and assignments/ with deadlines for that week.
