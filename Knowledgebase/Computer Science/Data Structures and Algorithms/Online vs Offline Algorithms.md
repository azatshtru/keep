To answer queries, we can use either online or offline algorithms.
If all the queries are known in advance, then an offline algorithm can be used. Offline algorithms are easier to implement than online algorithms.

If all the queries are not known in advance, then we must use an online algorithm to construct an efficient representation of the data structure to quickly answer all the incoming queries at any point.
