# Angel Investors and Seed Funds
Businesses need initial funding to setup. This initial funding is provided by **Angel Investors**. The funding is called a **Seed Fund**. Seed funds can come from friends, family or other investors who think your business idea is worthwhile.

Valuation of a company is measured by the amount of cash they have.
q initial valuation of the company is equal to the seed fund.
## Face Value of shares
In return of the Seed Fund, the Angel Investors get the shares of the company, which entitles them a part ownership of the company. To issue shares, the company assumes each share is worth some $x$, this initial assumption is called **Face Value** of the share, if the seed fund in some $n$, then the amount of shares will be $n/x$.

> There is a limit on setting the price for each share which is setup by SEBI.
# Venture Capitalists (VC)
If the business takes off and is somewhat profitable, then the business owner would want to increase the operations and scale of the business. To do so, he would need another round of investments. This round of investment comes from **Venture Capitalists**, who are investors that look for profitable businesses to invest. Venture Capitalists are willing to take a bit less risk than Angel Investors.

> This second round of investment is called **Series A** funding.
# CAPEX
The money the company spends on overall business expansion is called capital expenditure or CAPEX. To fund CAPEX, the companies can do a few things:
1. Fund through the profits made by running the business.
2. Do another round of Venture Capitalist investment (**Series B**, **Series C**, etc.)
3. Take a debt from the bank.
Good companies do a mix of the above steps to gather capital.
The more money the company gets, the more its evaluation.
# Private Equity (PE)
Beyond a certain size of the company, VCs don't invest and company will have to look for entities who are willing to invest very large sums of money so that the company could grow. This entity is called Private Equity.

- PE firms invest large sums of money
- The people from the PE firm join the company's board and have a weight in the decisions taken by the company. This is to ensure that the company moves in the right direction and stays profitable.
- PEs have a very lower "risk appetite" than VCs or Angel investors. The only invest in businesses they deem profitable.

Further **series** rounds of funding are provided to a business by PEs instead of VCs when the business grows to a sufficient size.
# [[IPOs]]
The company offers its shares to the general public to gather capital for even further growth, the general public purchase the shares and get profits when the company gets profits.
When the company offers its share for the first time to the general public, it is called an Initial Public Offering (IPO).
