Imagine visiting a fast-food street with more than 100 fast-food vendors. How would you possibly determine which place is the best? There are two ways.

1. Go to a bunch of fast-food vendors, analyse their process, ingredients, hygiene taste a bit, then determine which place is good.
2. Look at the crowd. If the crowd is frequenting a particular shop, there is a high chance that the food there would be good.

The first method corresponds to Fundamental Analysis where one researches a few companies thoroughly and independently to develop a point of view for investing in them.

The upside is that you develop a very strong point of view about the future of the company, but the downside is that this process is not scalable and quick, you can maybe research 6-7 companies out of thousands and can possibly miss out on some other great ones you didn't look at.

The second method corresponds to Technical Analysis, where one scans for opportunities based on the current trend, aka the marketâ€™s preference. The actions of market participants can be visualized in stock charts. Over time, patterns form in these charts, and each pattern conveys a certain message about trends in the market. We can identify these patterns and develop a point of view.

The advantage of technical analysis is that it is quick, but the disadvantage is that the POV you develop isn't strong.

FA is used for long term investments with long holding periods and high returns, while TA is used for short term trades with small but consistent profits.

If a trade goes wrong in TA, instead of holding like FA, cut the losses and move on with discipline.
