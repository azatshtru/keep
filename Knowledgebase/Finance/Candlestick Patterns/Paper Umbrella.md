A paper umbrella is characterized by a long lower shadow with a small upper body. To qualify a candle as a paper umbrella, the lower shadow's length should be at least twice the length of the real body. This is called the '**shadow to real body ratio**', i.e. $\frac{\text{(Low - Close)}}{\text{(Close - Open)}}$

A paper umbrella in itself doesn't mean much, it needs context of the trend.
If the paper umbrella appears at the bottom end of a downward rally, it is called the **Hammer**.
If the paper umbrella appears at the top end of an uptrend rally, it is called the **Hanging Man**.
If the graph is flat and there is no previous trend, then paper umbrella means nothing.
# Hammer
The hammer is a paper umbrella that appears after a downtrend. The color of the hammer doesn't matter as long as it appears after a downtrend, though a blueish candle is more comforting. The bears were taking the market price downwards until the hammer, but the long lower shadow of the hammer indicates that on the hammer day the bears did take the price downward as usual, but since the closing price was much higher than the lowest point of the shadow (almost equal to the opening price), it means that there was some positive interest which took the price higher again. This means that one can hope to see some positive trend moving forward after seeing a hammer after a downtrend.

Risk takers can qualify the day as a hammer by checking the following condition at 3:20 PM on the hammer day…
   1. Open and close should be almost the same (within 1-2% range)
   2. Lower shadow length should be at least twice the length of the real body.
   3. If both these conditions are met, then the pattern is a hammer, and the risk-taker can go long.
   
The risk-averse trader should evaluate the OHLC data on the 2nd If it’s a blue candle, the trade is valid so that he can go long.

The low of the hammer acts as the stoploss for the trade.
