Marubozu means bald in Japanese, in the sense that the candlesticks, without their wicks look bald.
# Bullish marubozu
In a bullish marubozu, low is about equal to the open and the high is about equal to the close, hence no (or unnoticable) wicks.
A bullish marubozu indicates that there is so much buying interest in the stock that the market participants were willing to buy the stock at every price point during the day, so much so that the stock closed near its high point for the day. It does not matter what the prior trend has been, the action on the marubozu day suggests that the sentiment has changed and the stock is now bullish.

The expectation is that with this sudden change in sentiment, there is a surge of bullishness, and this bullish sentiment will continue over the next few trading sessions. Hence a trader should look at buying opportunities with the occurrence of a bullish marubozu. The **buying price** should be around the closing price of the marubozu.

A **risk-taker** would buy the stock on the same day as the marubozu is being formed. However, the trader needs to validate the occurrence of a marubozu. Validating is quite simple. Indian markets close at 3:30 PM. So, around 3:20 PM one needs to check if the **current market price (CMP) is approximately equal to the high price for the day, and the opening price of the day is approximately equal to the low price the day**. If this condition is satisfied, you know the day is forming a marubozu, you can buy the stock around the closing price. It is also essential to note that the risk-taker is buying on a bullish/blue candle day, thereby following rule 1, i.e., buying on strength and selling on weakness.

A **risk-averse** trader would buy the stock on the next day, i.e. the day after the pattern has been formed. However, before buying the trader, ensure that the day is a bullish day to comply with rule number 1. This means the risk-averse buyer can buy the stock only around the close of the day. The disadvantage of buying the next day is that the buy price is way above the suggested buy price, and therefore the stoploss is quite deep. However, as a trade-off, the risk-averse trader is buying only after doubly confirming that the bullishness is indeed established.

In case of a bullish marubozu, the low of the stock acts as a stoploss.
# Bearish marubozu
In Bearish marubozu, open is equal to the high and close the is equal to low (about equal), indicating extreme bearishness such that the share was sold at any price point during the day, so much so that the stock closed near its low during the day.

This bearish sentiment will be carried over to the next few trading sessions and one should look for shorting opportunities. The selling price should be around the closing price of the marubozu.

The risk-taker can initiate a short trade on the same day around the closing. Of course, he has to make sure that the candle is forming a bearish marubozu. To do this at 3:20 PM, the trader must confirm if the open is approximately equal to the high and the current market price is equal to the low price. If the condition is validated, then it is a bearish marubozu, a short position can be initiated.

If the trader is risk-averse, he can wait till the next dayâ€™s closing. The short trade will go through only by 3:20 PM next day after ensuring that the day is a red candle day. This is also to ensure that we comply with 1st rule - Buy strength, and Sell weakness.
# Trade trap of marubozu
One should avoid trading during a minimal (below 1% range) or long candle (above 10% range).

A small candle indicates subdued trading activity, and hence it would be difficult to identify the direction of the trade. On the other hand, a long candle indicates extreme activity. The problem with lengthy candles would be the placement of stoploss. The stoploss would be deep, and in case the trade goes wrong, the penalty for paying would be painful. For this reason, one should avoid trading on candles that are either too short or too long.
