A spinning top has a small real body. The upper and lower wicks are almost equal in length. The color of the spinning top doesn't matter.

The small real body indicates that the opening and closing prices were similar.

The upper wick indicates that the bulls tried to take the share price higher, but failed since market closed at a price much lower than the upper wick as indicated by the small real body of the candle.

The lower wick indicates that the bears also tried to take the price lower on the same day, but like the bulls, they too failed.

Spinning top conveys indecision as both bulls and bears were not able to influence the markets.

A Doji is an extreme case of the Spinning top, where opening and closing prices are so similar that there is practically no real body of the candlesticks. Dojis, like spinning tops indicate heavy indecision in the market. The analysis of Spinning tops and Dojis is similar.

Dojis sometime indicate a trend of indecision and spinning tops for the next few candles.
# Implications of spinning tops in a downtrend
If the prices of some stock have been falling for sometime, but suddenly a doji or spinning top appears, then it could mean that the bears could be consolidating their position before resuming another bout of selling, giving some leeway for the bulls to attempt taking the price up.

Since there is indecision, there are equal 50% chances of stock going either up or down. However, since the indecision happened on a downtrend, if by 50% probability the trend reverses and price starts going up, then it is an opportunity to buy the share at a lower price before the start of an uptrend. But since it's only 50% chance of going up, one should buy half the amount of stocks he intended to buy just to test the waters before full commitment. If by the other 50% probability the price continues falling, then one would only book a loss on half his shares.
# Implications of spinning tops in an uptrend
With the formation of spinning tops, the bears have made an entry to the markets. Though not successful, the emphasis is on the fact that the bulls gave leeway to bears.

In context of uptrend, spinning tops can mean two things..
1. The bulls could be consolidating their position before initiating another leg of the up move.
2. Or the bulls are fatigued and may give way to bears. Hence a correction could be around the corner.
The chances of both these events taking place are equal, i.e. 50%.

This could be an indication to sell and book a profit on some stock you have been holding for sometime since the price might start falling with 50% probability. However the price might also keep going up with 50% probability and you might miss out on further profits.

To stay safe while also not limiting the further potential profit, one can sell half the amount of shares he owns. If the price reverses, then one can sell the remaining half of the shares, and if the price continues going upwards, then he'll still have half the remaining shared to rally up with the bulls.
# Bottom line of spinning tops
During a spinning top, if you own some shares, consider selling half of it and if you want to buy some stock, consider buying half the amount you intended to buy.

This strategy will reduce the amount of loss you're going to book while also keeping the amount of profit in sufficiently higher.
