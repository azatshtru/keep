The stock market is the place to transact in equities. Stock markets exist electronically and can be accessed through a stockbroker. In India there are two Stock Exchanges where people can buy stocks: BSE and NSE.

There are five types of entities that participate in transacting in the stock market:
1. **Domestic Retail Participants** – These are people like you and me transacting in markets
2. **NRI’s and OCI** – These are people of Indian origin but based outside India
3. **Domestic Institutions** – These are corporate entities in India
4. **Domestic Asset Management Companies (AMC)** – Mutual fund companies like SBI Mutual Fund, HDFC AMC, Edelweiss, ICICI Pru, etc.
5. **Foreign Institutional Investors** – Non-Indian corporate entities. These could be foreign asset management companies, hedge funds, and other investors.
# Entities in the Stock Markets
## Regulators
To regulate malpractice, regulatory entity SEBI is setup:
1. SEBI is the regulator of the securities market in India. They set the legal framework and regulate all entities interested in operating in the market.
2. Most importantly, you need to remember that SEBI is aware of what you are doing, and they can flag you down if you are up to something fishy in the markets!
3. Under SEBI, there are multiple entities, each assigned to regulate a specific part of the stock market.
## Stock Brokers
A stockbroker is an entity that trades with the Stock Exchanges on behalf of the market participants. Stock brokers are licensed by SEBI and follow the guidelines set by SEBI.

Market participants need to open a **trading account** with the stockbroker to begin trading.
## Depository
When we buy shares through our trading account, an electronic certificate is generated, this certificate allows the Stock Exchanges to validate that the purchase of stocks from one market participant to the other occurred. However these certificates are not stored in the trading account provided by the stock broker.

The ability to manage the transaction certificates is given to entities known as **Depositories**, Depositories are regulated by SEBI as well. In India there are two Depositories: NSDL and CDSL.

Depositories provide **DEMAT accounts** for storing and managing the transaction certificates. A market participant needs a trading account for buying and selling shares along with a DEMAT account for storing and managing the transaction certificates.

To open a DEMAT account, one needs to talk to a Depository Participant (DP), who acts as an intermediary between the market participant and the depository.

The stock brokers can also work in the backend and open a DEMAT account on behalf of the market participant registered with them. This DEMAT account is connected by the trading account provided by the stock broker.

When the user purchases stock, he uses the trading account to transact and money is deducted from his trading account, but the certificate of transactions is kept in the DEMAT account. When he sells the shares, the money is transferred into his trading account and the certificates in DEMAT account are updated accordingly.
## Bank accounts
Other than trading account and DEMAT account, the user also has a bank account which is managed by banks. The bank account is used to transfer money to and from the trading account, so that it can be used for trading.
## Clearing corporations
Clearing corporations like ICCL have the work of ensuring that the funds that were sold by one user and purchased by some other user while trading in the Stock Exchange reach their respective places.
