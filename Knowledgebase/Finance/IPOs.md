# Components of IPO
## Merchant Bankers
Companies appoint merchant bankers as a first step to assist them in setting up an IPO.

After appointing merchant bankers, a registration statement needs to be sent to SEBI for approval, this statement highlights reasons for the company to go public and also highlights the financial health of the company.

Merchant bankers help in conducting due diligence and hiring other intermediaries, namely, registrars, bankers, advertising agencies, etc. to assist in filing the IPOs.
## DRHP
Draft Red Herring Prospect is a document that is prepared by the merchant banker to circulate in the public. DRHP highlight the following:
- The estimated size of the IPO
- The estimated number of shares being offered to the public
- Why the company wants to go public, and how does the company plan to utilize the funds along with the timeline projection of fund utilization
- Business description including the revenue model, expenditure details
- Complete financial statements
- Management Discussion and Analysis – how the company perceives future business operations to emerge
- Risks involved in the business
- Management details and their background
## Price bands
Merchant bankers help companies reach a price band, A price band gives an upper and lower limit for the share price within which the company sells shares in the IPO.

After this the IPO is marketed to the public. This is called a **roadshow**
## Book building
Book building is a method that is used to approximate and discover the effective starting price for the share, typically after the roadshow, a window is opened where the public can subscribe to the share according to the price between the upper and lower limit of the price band which they think is right for the IPO. The public opinion on price point is collected and is used to determine the opening price for the IPO.
## Underwriting shares
The merchant bankers agree to buy the unsubscribed portion of the IPO if it reaches above a certain threshold. If the IPO is not subscribed enough and stays below the threshold, then the IPO is said to have failed.
## Closure and Listing Day
Listing day is the day where the shares of the company are available in the stock exchange based on the price point which received maximum bids during Book Building. This price can is influenced by the market demand and supply that day and can be premium, par or discount of the cut-off price.

The entire system of bidding for IPO within the price bands is called participating in the Primary Market.
When the shared become available to the public on a daily basis as regular stocks, then they are part of the secondary market.
# Some key IPO jargon
1. **Under subscription** - Let’s say the company wants to offer 100,000 shares to the public. During the book-building process, it was discovered that only 90,000 bids were received, then the issue is said to be under-subscribed. This is not a great situation, as it indicates negative public sentiment.

2. **Oversubscription** - If there are 200,000 bids for 100,000 shares on offer, then the issue is said to be oversubscribed two times (2x)

3. **Green Shoe Option** - Part of the issue document that allows the issuer to authorize additional shares (typically 15 percent) to be distributed in the event of oversubscription. This is also called the overallotment option.

4. **Fixed Price IPO** - Sometimes, the companies fix the price of the IPO and do not opt for a price band. Such issues are called fixed-price IPO

5. **Price Band and Cut off price** - A price band is a price range between which the stock gets listed. For example, if the price band is between Rs.100 and Rs.130, then the issue can list within the range. Let’s say it gets listed at 125; 125 is the cut-off price.
