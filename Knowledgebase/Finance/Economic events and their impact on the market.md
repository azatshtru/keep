Gauging economic events helps in developing the point of view on the market and various sectors.
# Inflation
Inflation is a sustained increase in the general prices of goods and services. Increasing inflation erodes the purchasing power of money. Inflation indicated uneasiness in the market.

Inflation is caused when there is more demand for a good or service, but less supply. If more people want to purchase something, then the seller has an incentive to increase the prices.

Inflation is measured using two indices, Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI). In India, A national statistical agency, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), publishes the CPI numbers around the 2nd week of every month.
- **Wholesale Price Index (WPI)** - The WPI indicates the movement in prices at the wholesale level, the level at which institutions purchase goods and services to run their businesses, etc.
- **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** - The CPI captures the effect of the change in prices at a retail level. The calculation of CPI is quite detailed, it involves classifying consumption into various categories and subcategories across urban and rural regions. Each of these categories is made into an index, the final CPI index is a composition of several internal indices. The CPI captures the effect of inflation on daily household consumables like fruits, vegetables, cereals, and even fuels like petrol and diesel.

The Central/Federal Reserve Banks of each country have the job to regulate inflation to maintain balance in the market. This is done through monetary policies.
# Monetary policy
Monetary policy is a tool through which federal reserves control the interest rates by which they grant money to or acquire money from the banks.
## Repo rate
The rate by which banks can borrow money from the Central/Federal Reserve Bank.

If Repo rate is high, then it would be harder for banks to acquire money, and it would be even harder for corporations or consumers to acquire money for their ventures from the banks. As a result, money in the market will be tight and growth of organisations, and the country as a whole will reduce.

However, if the Repo rate is low, then it would be easier for banks, corporations and consumers to acquire money, this would lead to consumers being able to spend more and demand for goods and services increasing. If the Repo rate is very low, then there might be more demand for goods and services, even more than the supply, which would lead to inflation.

Thus, repo rate can be increased to decrease the flow of money in the market, and it can be decreased to increase the flow of money in the market. The reserves increase the repo rate to regulate inflation, and they decrease the repo rate when the economy requires more money for growth.
## Reverse Repo rate
Reverse repo rate is the interest rate which the Central/Federal Reserves borrow money from the banks in the country.

If reverse repo rate is high, then it means that banks will receive more money when they park their funds with the Reserves. This leads to banks depositing more money to the Reserves which reduces money in the market and can tighten the economy, slowing down growth. Usually governments increase the reverse repo rate when they want money for the development of infrastructure of the country.

If reverse repo rate is balanced, then the banks will not park funds with the Reserves that often, which would lead to more money in the market, promoting growth, however, if reverse repo rate is very low, then it will cause inflation due to excess money in the market.
## Cash Reserve Ratio
The CRR dictates the minimum amount that the commercial banks must maintain with the Central/Federal Reserve Banks. This CRR is determined by the Central Reserve Bank for each commercial bank. If CRR is increased, then the commercial banks must maintain more money with the Reserve, and more money will be sucked out of the economy, reducing growth. CRR must also be balanced.
# Index of Industrial Production (IIP)
The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is a short-term indicator of the country’s industrial sector’s progress. In India, the data is released every month (along with inflation data) by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI). The IIP measures the Indian industrial sectors’ production, keeping a fixed reference point. As of today, India uses the reference point of 2004-05. The reference point is also called the base year.

Roughly about 15 different industries submit their production data to the ministry, which collates the data and releases it as an index number. If the IIP increases, it indicates a vibrant industrial environment (as the production is going up) and hence a positive sign for the economy and markets. A decreasing IIP indicates a sluggish production environment, hence a negative sign for the economy and markets.

An upswing in industrial production is good for the economy, and a downswing rings an alarm. A lower IIP number puts pressure on the RBI to lower the interest rates and aid industrial credit with cheaper credit.
# Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)
The Purchasing managers’ index (PMI) is an economic indicator that tries to capture business activity across the country’s manufacturing and service sectors. This is a survey-based indicator where the respondents (usually the purchasing managers) indicate their business perception change concerning the previous month. A separate survey is conducted for the service and manufacturing sectors. The data from the survey are consolidated on a single index. Typical areas covered in the survey include new orders, output, business expectations, and employment.

The PMI number usually oscillates around 50. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, and below 50 indicates a contraction in the economy. And reading at 50 indicates no change in the economy.
# Budget
A Budget is an event during which the Ministry of Finance discusses the country’s finance in detail. The Finance Minister, on behalf of the ministry, makes a budget presentation to the entire country. During the budget, major policy announcements and economic reforms are announced, which impacts various industries across the markets. Therefore the budget plays a vital role in the economy.

For example, if in one of the budgets, the Finance Minister raised the duties on a cigarette, and hence the prices increased. An increased cigarette price has a few implications:
1. Increased cigarette prices discourage smokers from buying cigarettes, and hence the profitability of the cigarette manufacturing companies such as ITC decreases. If the profitability decreases, investors may want to sell shares of ITC.
2. If market participants start selling ITC, the markets will come down because ITC is an index heavyweight.

A budget is an annual event, and it is announced during the last week of February in India. However, the budget announcement could be delayed under certain special circumstances, such as a new government formation.
# Corporate Earnings announcement of quarterly earnings numbers
The listed companies trading on the stock exchange must declare their earnings once every quarter, also called the quarterly earnings numbers. During an earnings announcement, the corporate gives out details on various operational activities, including:
1. Revenue growth
2. Expense trend
3. Finance charges
4. Profitability trends
5. Project updates
6. Key trends in the industry
Besides, some companies give an overview of what to expect from the upcoming quarters. This forecast is called ‘corporate guidance.’

In India, the financial year begins on April 1 and the quarters are divided as follows:
- Q1 - April to June
- Q2 - July to September
- Q3 - October to December
- Q4 - January to March

> In the USA, the financial year begins on January 1.
## street expectations
Every quarter when the company declares its earnings, the market participants match the earnings with their expectations of how much the company should have earned. The market participant’s expectation is called the ‘street expectation.’

The stock price will react positively if the company’s earnings are better than the street expectations. The stock price will react negatively if the actual numbers are lower than the street expectation.

If the street expectation and actual numbers match, the stock price tends to trade flat with a negative bias more often than not. This is mainly because the company could not give any positive surprises.
# Other events that aren't directly financial..
..but still affect the economy in specific ways.

It would be beneficial to watch out for other non-financial events like pandemics or wars to understand their impact on markets. Two examples follow..
1. The Covid crisis of 2020 had a significant effect on economies around the world, disrupting the world economic order. The supply chain took a hit across the globe leading to an inflation spike. That said, there were select pockets of the economy that did very well, mainly the online services industry.
2. Events like the Russia-Ukraine war or the tension between China and Taiwan have impacted world markets. Geo-political affairs such as these impact various connected economies. For instance, the war between Russia and Ukraine affects the supply of natural gas and crude oil, which significantly impacts the energy costs in Europe.

As an active trader or a market participant, you need to watch out for these events and understand how these events can impact the markets. While the world economies are interconnected, isolated events (Country specific) impact the local economy. For example, the elections in India impact only the Indian economy. Do not overlook non-financial events as they can grant some very specific point of views on the market.
