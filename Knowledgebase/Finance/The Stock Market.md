# the Stock market is opinionated
Two people can have different opinions on a decision made by a company. A change of CEO could mean "company will get a new direction" for some people, while the same news could mean "a change will bring instability" for other people.

People with positive opinions regarding the news buy the shares of the company.
People with negative opinion regarding the news sell the shares they own, and those shares become available on the stock exchange for people with positive opinions to buy.

> Bottom line, people with opposing views trade stocks with each other.
## opinions change
If there is a really good news regarding a company, then the opinions of a lot of people change. If the new CEO took some great decisions that lead to higher valuation of the company and it made the news, then a lot of people would want to own the shares of an increasing valued company.

The demand for the shares of the company is high. This is where the people who were initially hopeful about the company make a profit. If a person bought the shares for a lower price before the company made good news, then he can sell the shares for the higher price due to increasing demand, and can make a profit. This increases the valuation of the company as the share price people are willing to pay to own a part of it has increased. Similarly, people who bought the share at the moderate price can sell it for even higher to other demandees.
## stock market reacts to the news, mostly
A good news about a company is likely to bring its prices up as more people will want to own a high valuation company. A bad news about a company is will bring the prices down as more people will sell the stocks at any price to save themselves from losing money they invested in a company, as the company is getting undervalued.

News about other companies, sectors, or government decision can affect the share prices as well. If the government decides to invest less in space-tech, then the space-tech companies will likely suffer a share price fall. If a company in some other sector stops producing a certain kind of good required by some other company, then the prices will be affected. If the sector hasn't produced much advancements lately or some other company in the sector is falling, it is likely to affect the other companies in the same sector and so on.

Share prices of larger, well known companies move constantly as many people constantly buy and sell their shares, while smaller companies' share prices move marginally.
# participating in the stock market
If you decide to buy 100 shares of some company, then you login through your trading account, specify the amount and price of the share you intend to buy and proceed.

In the background, the stock exchange uses a matching algorithm to find people who are willing to sell the shares at the price you requested, say the algorithm finds three people agreeing to sell 74, 16 and 10 stocks at the requested price, then the sale is executed and shares are credited to your DEMAT account.
## you own the company, a little bit
When you own shares of a company, you become part owner of that company. Owning 100 shares of a sufficiently large enough company can make you say, 0.000035% owner of the company.
## holding period
holding period is the amount of time you decide to hold the stock after buying before selling.
## trading vs investing
A trader is a person who has a short term view of the markets and initiates small frequent trades by constantly evaluating the profit and loss opportunities in the market and sells as early as possible at the first given opportunity based on risk and reward. They have a very less holding period.
1. **Day Trader** – A day trader initiates and closes the position during the day. He does not carry forward trading positions overnight. A day trader is risk-averse and does not like taking an overnight risk. For example – Buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 at 9:15 AM and sell it at 2220 at 3:20 PM, making a profit of Rs.800/- in this trade. A day trader usually trades 5 to 6 stocks per day, sometimes even more.
2. **Scalper** – A type of day trader. A scalper usually trades very large shares and holds the stock for less time to make a small but quick profit. For example – a scalper buys 10,000 shares of TCS as 2212 at 9:15 and sells it 2212.1 at 9.16, ending up making 1000/- profit in this trade. On any given day, the scalper trades multiple times during the day. As you may have noticed, a scalp trader is highly risk-averse.
3. **Swing Trader** – A swing trader holds on to the trade for a slightly longer; the duration can run anywhere between a few days to weeks. For example – Buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 on 12th June and sell it at 2214 on 19th June.

An investor has a much longer holding period than a trader, and they appreciate the greater idea of an organization.
1. **Growth Investors** – The objective here is to identify companies expected to grow significantly because of emerging industry and macro trends. A classic example in the Indian context would be buying Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, and Gillette India back in 1990s. These companies witnessed huge growth because of the change in the industry landscape, creating massive wealth for their shareholders.
2. **Value Investors** – The objective here is to identify good companies irrespective of whether they are in the growth or mature phase but beaten down significantly due to the short-term market sentiment, thereby making a great value buy. An example of this in recent times is stock tanking in the Covid crash of March 2020. Due to short-term negative sentiment, almost all the good stocks were beaten down significantly around March/April 2020, only to post a V-shaped recovery in the subsequent months.
# calculating returns
## absolute return
This gives a measure based on the money put in and the money put out during the investment.
$$\frac{\text{ending period value}}{\text{starting period value - 1}}* 100$$
## compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
this factors in the time component while measuring returns
$$\text{CAGR} = \frac{\text{ending value}}{\text{beginning value}}^{(1/\text{number of years})}-1$$
# free-float market cap
free-float market cap is calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares of a company by the value of a single share. For example, if company A has 100 outstanding shares of 50 each, then the free-float market cap is 5000.

free-float market cap is used to measure the percentage of effect of the stock on the market.
# Stock Market Indices
To measure the performance of the market as a whole, instead of looking at all of the listed stocks individually, we measure the performance of some selected stocks that have the most impact on the market.

In India there are two indices: **S&P BSE** and **Nifty 50**, both are collections of companies who have the most impact in terms of free-float market cap. These indices are prepared by BSE and NSE respectively.

sector specific indices also exist, for example **Bank Nifty** is a collection of most influential company in the banking sector and **CNX IT** represents the performance of the IT sector.
## Using the stock market indices
### Information
Index reflects the overall trend of the market.
### Benchmarking
To compare one's own performance against the index. For example, if you made 20% percent profit, but Nifty 50 moved 30% up, then you have underperformed the market. The goal, obviously, is to outperform the market.
### Trading
Trading on the index means taking the broader call on the economy as a whole. Purchasing shares of an index directly invests in all of the major listed companies in it. If the government takes some good decision during the annual budget in the country, then the economy is expected to rise as a whole and it can be a good idea to purchase the shares of an index like Nifty 50.
## Portfolio Hedging
Investors usually have a portfolio (a collection) of stocks that they invest in for the long term. Investors can analyze the trends in the index to foresee an adverse movement in the market and **hedge** (take another position to offset the losses) their portfolio accordingly.
# Commonly used stock market jargon

1. Capital Market (CM) – Capital market segments offer tradable securities, such as stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). So if you were to buy or sell shares of a company, you are essentially operating in the capital market segment. Shorting stocks, too, comes under the capital market segment. The cash market is sometimes referred to as the spot market.

## longs and shorts and squaring offs
You are **long** about a share price, when you expect it to go up. You hold a short position when you expect the share price to go down.

Shares can be sold before they are bought. If you sell a share you do not own at a higher price, and then the value of the share goes down, then you can buy back the share at a lower price and make a profit. This is called **shorting** or a **short trade**.

- **Squaring off** - Buying back from a short position is called squaring off the short position. Selling a share on which you hold the long position is called squaring off the long position.
- **Intraday** - This is a trading position you initiate with an expectation to square off the position within the same day.

Unless you're in a derivative market, you have to buy back the short before the market closes that day. In other words, shorts are traded intraday.
## trading terminal jargon
When buying a stock, we have to specify some information other than how many shares we wish to purchase.
### order types
- **CNC** - Specify this if you wish to hold the shares for a long enough time.
- **MIS** - Specify if you wish to trade intraday.
- **limited price** - A limit indicates the price you are willing to buy the shares for, if you place an order with a limit, the trade will only get executed if someone is willing to sell you the shares for the limit price you specified, otherwise the trade will never get executed.
- **market order** - If you don't specify a limit, then you are willing to buy the share for market available prices. This is called a market order.
- **stop-loss** - To avoid against market crashes, a trigger price can be specified, which automatically sells the shares if the price falls below a certain specified threshold. This is called a stop loss order.
### receipts and tracking 
- **order book** - An order book lets you track orders that are both open and completed.
- **trade book** - trade book tracks the receipt of the approved and completed orders, it allows us to track the stocks we have purchased.
## bid and offer
**offer price** - when you intend to buy a particular stock, you look at the offer prices of that stock. Offer prices list the available prices offered by the sellers that hold the shares and are willing to sell them.

| Sl No | Offer Price | Offer Quantity | Number of Sellers |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| 01    | 3294.80     | 2              | 2                 |
| 02    | 3294.85     | 4              | 2                 |
| 03    | 3295.00     | 8              | 2                 |
| 04    | 3296.20     | 25             | 1                 |
| 05    | 3296.25     | 5              | 1                 |
This table indicates that there are 2 shares available at 3294.80 and 4 shares available at 3294.85 and 8 shares available at 3295.00, practically this means that if you wish to purchase 7 shares, then you will pay $2\cdot 3294.80 + 4 \cdot 3294.85 + 1 \cdot 3295.00$

Not all shares are sold to you at the same price, it depends on how many sellers are willing to sell at the prices.

**bid price** - when you intend to sell a particular stock, you can look at the bid price table, which tells how many buyers are willing to purchase shares at given prices.

|Sl No|Bid Price|Bid Quantity|Number of Buyers|

|01|3294.75|10|5|
|02|3294.20|6|1|
|03|3294.15|1|1|
|04|3293.85|6|1|

# Clearing and settlement process in Indian stock market
When you buy shares, along with the share price there are a few other charges
1. Brokerage
2. Security Transaction charges (STT)
3. Exchange transaction charges
4. GST
5. SEBI charges
6. Stamp duty, which is 0.015% of the bought share volume, for example if you buy shares worth 100000, then the stamp duty would be 15

The day you buy the shares is referred to as the **T-day**, after T-day, the funds in your trading account that were used to buy the shares are blocked and it takes some time for the purchase to be cleared, a lot of authorities are to be considered like SEBI, clearing corporation, depository, etc. which takes time. After clearance, the shares are credited to your DEMAT account and funds from your trading account are gone.

Similarly for selling shares, the day you sell the shares is called the T-day, it takes some time to consider and get approval from all the market intermediaries, so the sell is cleared after some time from the T day and after all that process, the funds come into your trading account and the shares leave your DEMAT account and go to the depository.

India is the first country to implement T+1 clearance process, which means that the buy and sell of stocks are cleared just one day after the purchase, previously it was T+2.
## earmarking
During the T+2 settlement days, when someone sold some shares, the shares were debited from the seller's account and were stored in the broker's pool account. Until the sell was approved from the clear corporation the shares would be in the broker's account. At the T+2 day, the shares would be transferred to the clearing corporation and the funds would be transferred to the seller's trading account.

This means that the broker holds the shares for the entirety of T+1 without the seller getting any returns. During this intermediate period, the broker can misuse the shares. To reduce the risk of this, SEBI introduced earmarking.

Instead of the shares leaving the seller's account, they would be earmarked for settlement. This removes the need for broker's pool account holding the shares for intermediate period. On the settlement day, the shares are debited from the seller's trading account and transferred to the clearing corporation.
# Corporate actions and their impact on stock prices
Corporate actions are financial initiatives undertaken by a company that results in a change to its stock price.
## Dividends
Dividends are portions of profits made by the company, which are distributed to the company’s shareholders. Dividends are paid to all the share holders on every share they own. If you own 100 shares of a company and the company decides to pay a dividend of 42, then you get 4200.

Dividends are sometimes expressed as percentages of face values, for example if the face value of a stock was 5, and a dividend of 40 was paid, then the dividend is 800% of the face value and it will be announced like "company X is paying a dividend of 800%".

When a company pays dividends, the money is gone from its balance sheets, and hence the valuation of the company reduces, this means that the stock prices of a company will drop by some amount. For example, if the company pays dividends of 15, then the share price will drop by 15. However, shareholders do not go into loss due to the price fall because they get the dividend money.

It is not mandatory to pay dividends for a company. A company pays dividends usually when they have excess cash reserves. The company can choose to use the excess cash for their own development.
### Timeline of dividends
The company’s board members at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) decide whether to pay a dividend. The dividends are not paid right after the announcement.
- **Dividend Declaration Date** - This is the date on which the AGM takes place, and the company’s board approves the dividend issue
- **Record Date** - The date the company decides to review the shareholder’s register to list all eligible shareholders for the dividend. Usually, the time difference between the dividend declaration date and the record date is 30 days.
- **Ex-Date/Ex-Dividend date** - With the T+1 settlement cycle, the ex-dividend date normally is on the same day as the record date. Only shareholders who own the shares before the ex-dividend date are entitled to receive the dividend.
- **Dividend Payout Date** - The date on which the dividends are paid to shareholders listed in the company register.
- **Cum Dividend** - The shares are said to be cum dividends till the ex-dividend date.
- **Interim vs final dividends** - If the dividend is paid during the financial year, it is called the interim dividend. If the dividend is paid at the end of the financial year, it is called the final dividend.
## Bonus Issue
If the share price of a company becomes too bloated, and it becomes very hard for newer shareholders in the market to purchase its shares, then the company can choose to issue bonus shares to the share holder. These are issued over ratios 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, etc. These shares are awarded from company's reserves.

For example, if someone owns 30 shares of a company where each share is worth 550 and the company allots a bonus issue with ratio 3:1, then the shareholder will get 3 additional shares for each share he owns, i.e. he will have 120 shares (four times what he originally had) after the issue, and the company will reduce the share price 4 times, i.e. instead of 550, the new share price will be 550/4 = 137.5
