# the Stock market is opinionated
Two people can have different opinions on a decision made by a company. A change of CEO could mean "company will get a new direction" for some people, while the same news could mean "a change will bring instability" for other people.

People with positive opinions regarding the news buy the shares of the company.
People with negative opinion regarding the news sell the shares they own, and those shares become available on the stock exchange for people with positive opinions to buy.

> Bottom line, people with opposing views trade stocks with each other.
## opinions change
If there is a really good news regarding a company, then the opinions of a lot of people change. If the new CEO took some great decisions that lead to higher valuation of the company and it made the news, then a lot of people would want to own the shares of an increasing valued company.

The demand for the shares of the company is high. This is where the people who were initially hopeful about the company make a profit. If a person bought the shares for a lower price before the company made good news, then he can sell the shares for the higher price due to increasing demand, and can make a profit. This increases the valuation of the company as the share price people are willing to pay to own a part of it has increased. Similarly, people who bought the share at the moderate price can sell it for even higher to other demandees.
## stock market reacts to the news, mostly
A good news about a company is likely to bring its prices up as more people will want to own a high valuation company. A bad news about a company is will bring the prices down as more people will sell the stocks at any price to save themselves from losing money they invested in a company, as the company is getting undervalued.

News about other companies, sectors, or government decision can affect the share prices as well. If the government decides to invest less in space-tech, then the space-tech companies will likely suffer a share price fall. If a company in some other sector stops producing a certain kind of good required by some other company, then the prices will be affected. If the sector hasn't produced much advancements lately or some other company in the sector is falling, it is likely to affect the other companies in the same sector and so on.

Share prices of larger, well known companies move constantly as many people constantly buy and sell their shares, while smaller companies' share prices move marginally.
# participating in the stock market
If you decide to buy 100 shares of some company, then you login through your trading account, specify the amount and price of the share you intend to buy and proceed.

In the background, the stock exchange uses a matching algorithm to find people who are willing to sell the shares at the price you requested, say the algorithm finds three people agreeing to sell 74, 16 and 10 stocks at the requested price, then the sale is executed and shares are credited to your DEMAT account.
## you own the company, a little bit
When you own shares of a company, you become part owner of that company. Owning 100 shares of a sufficiently large enough company can make you say, 0.000035% owner of the company.
## holding period
holding period is the amount of time you decide to hold the stock after buying before selling.
## trading vs investing
A trader is a person who has a short term view of the markets and initiates small frequent trades by constantly evaluating the profit and loss opportunities in the market and sells as early as possible at the first given opportunity based on risk and reward. They have a very less holding period.
1. **Day Trader** – A day trader initiates and closes the position during the day. He does not carry forward trading positions overnight. A day trader is risk-averse and does not like taking an overnight risk. For example – Buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 at 9:15 AM and sell it at 2220 at 3:20 PM, making a profit of Rs.800/- in this trade. A day trader usually trades 5 to 6 stocks per day, sometimes even more.
2. **Scalper** – A type of day trader. A scalper usually trades very large shares and holds the stock for less time to make a small but quick profit. For example – a scalper buys 10,000 shares of TCS as 2212 at 9:15 and sells it 2212.1 at 9.16, ending up making 1000/- profit in this trade. On any given day, the scalper trades multiple times during the day. As you may have noticed, a scalp trader is highly risk-averse.
3. **Swing Trader** – A swing trader holds on to the trade for a slightly longer; the duration can run anywhere between a few days to weeks. For example – Buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 on 12th June and sell it at 2214 on 19th June.

An investor has a much longer holding period than a trader, and they appreciate the greater idea of an organization.
1. **Growth Investors** – The objective here is to identify companies expected to grow significantly because of emerging industry and macro trends. A classic example in the Indian context would be buying Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, and Gillette India back in 1990s. These companies witnessed huge growth because of the change in the industry landscape, creating massive wealth for their shareholders.
2. **Value Investors** – The objective here is to identify good companies irrespective of whether they are in the growth or mature phase but beaten down significantly due to the short-term market sentiment, thereby making a great value buy. An example of this in recent times is stock tanking in the Covid crash of March 2020. Due to short-term negative sentiment, almost all the good stocks were beaten down significantly around March/April 2020, only to post a V-shaped recovery in the subsequent months.
# calculating returns
## absolute return
This gives a measure based on the money put in and the money put out during the investment.
$$\frac{\text{ending period value}}{\text{starting period value - 1}}* 100$$
## compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
this factors in the time component while measuring returns
$$\text{CAGR} = \frac{\text{ending value}}{\text{beginning value}}^{(1/\text{number of years})}-1$$
