# Why technical analysis?
Fundamental analysis dives deep into details, but it makes it domain-specific. For example, when dealing with an agricultural commodity like Coffee or Pepper, the fundamental analysis includes analyzing rainfall, harvest, demand, supply, inventory etc. However, the fundamentals of metal commodities are different, so it is for energy commodities. So every time you choose a commodity, the fundamentals change and you have to spend more time and resources in developing analysis for different domains.

On the other hand, the concept of technical analysis will remain the same irrespective of the asset you are studying because it uses generalized rules, patterns, indices and measures. For example, an indicator such as Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) or Relative strength index (RSI) is used the same way on equity, commodity, or currency. Once you learn to drive a car, you can drive any car.
# Assumptions of technical analysis
1. Markets discount everything - This assumption tells us that all known and unknown information in the public domain is reflected in the latest stock price. For example, an insider could buy the company’s stock in large quantities in anticipation of a good quarterly earnings announcement. While the insider does this secretively, the price reacts, revealing to the technical analyst that something is about to happen in the stock price.

2. The "how" is more important than the "why" - This is an extension of the first assumption. Going with the same example discussed above - the technical analyst would not be interested in questioning **why** the insider bought the stock as long as the technical analyst knows **how** the price reacted to the insider’s action.

3. Price moves in trend - All major moves in the market are an outcome of a trend. The concept of trend is the foundation of technical analysis. For example, the recent upward movement in the NIFTY 50 Index to 18500 from 14750 did not happen overnight. This move happened in a phased manner in over 11 months. Another way to look at it is that once the trend is established, the price moves in the direction of the trend.

4. History tends to repeat itself - In the technical analysis context, the price trend tends to repeat itself. This happens because the market participants consistently react to price movements in remarkably similar ways every time the price moves in a certain direction. For example, in an uptrend, market participants get greedy and want to buy irrespective of the high price. Likewise, market participants want to sell in a downtrend irrespective of the low and unattractive prices. This human reaction has been the same towards stock prices over time, ensuring that history repeats itself.
# OHLC: A simple trend measure
In Technical Analysis, different measures are used to analyze market trends, as a first example take OHLC.
**Open Price** - When the markets open for trading, the first price a trade executes is called the opening price.

**The High Price -** This represents the highest price at which a trade occurred for the given day.

**The Low Price -** This represents the lowest price at which a trade occurred for the given day.

**The Close Price -** This is the most important price because it is the final price at which the market closes for the day. The close indicates the intraday strength and a reference price for the next day. If the close is higher than the open, it is considered a positive day; otherwise negative.

The closing price also shows the market sentiment and serves as a reference point for the next day’s trading. For these reasons, closing is more important than the opening, high or low prices.
