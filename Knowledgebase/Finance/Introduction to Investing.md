# Why invest?
1. **Fight Inflation** – By investing, one can deal better with the inevitable reality of life – the growing cost of living – generally referred to as Inflation.
2. **Create Wealth** – By investing, one can build a bigger corpus by the end of the target period. In the above example, the period was up to retirement, but it can be anything – children’s education, marriage, house purchase, retirement holidays, etc
3. **Better life** – To meet life’s financial aspirations.
# Where to invest?
## Fixed income instruments
This is the safest method where we keep money with an entity and the entity pays interest on the principal amount we invested.

A few entities for fixed-income instruments are –
1. Bank’s Fixed deposits
2. Bonds issued by the Government of India (also called G Sec bonds and T Bills)
3. Bonds issued by Government related agencies such as GAIL, HUDCO, NHAI, etc
4. Bonds issued by corporate’s (Tata, Bajaj, Reliance, Adani)

- The typical return from a fixed-income instrument (bank’s FD) varies between 5 – 6%.
- Government bonds offer about 5.5%
- a few corporate bonds offer nearly 9 or 10%.
- Government bonds are much safer than the corporate bonds because government can't run away with your money.
## Equity
This involves buying the shares of publicly listed companies.
Shares are traded on Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE).

Compared to Fixed Income deposits, this method involves a bit risk, but it guarantees much higher returns than Fixed Income Instruments. Equities generate upwards of 12% - 20% CAGR.
## Real Estate
Buying and Selling land, vacant plots, apartments, commercial buildings, etc.
There are two sources of income from this:
1. Rental income
2. Capital appreciation of the investment amount, i.e. selling the land at a higher price than it was bought in.

The transaction process of buying and selling real estate can be quite complex, involving legal verification of documents. But.. the returns are much higher.
## Bullion
Gold and Silver provide returns of 5-8%
There are several ways to invest in Gold, electronic or real:
1. buying jewelry
2. Exchange Traded Funds (ETF)
3. Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)


A good investment portfolio combines all of the asset classes above to generate good profit that accounts for risk in a structured way.
For instance, a young professional may take a higher risk given the age and years of investment available. Typically investors should allocate at least 60% of their investable amount in equity, 20% in precious metals, and 20% in fixed-income investments. The percentage mix changes based on risk profile and age. For example, a retired person could invest 80% in fixed income (Govt bonds maybe), 10% in equity markets, and 10% in precious metals.
