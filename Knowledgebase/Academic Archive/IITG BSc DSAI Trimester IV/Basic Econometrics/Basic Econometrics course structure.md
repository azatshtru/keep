## Course Outline   
##### Recap of Basic Statistics   
1. Recap of probability and Random Variables, Expectation, Variance, higher moments, median   
2. Estimation, sampling and Inference   
##### Classical Linear Regression   
1. Assumptions and Model (Classical Linear regression)   
2. Estimation procedure (ordinary least square method and the method of moments), Unbiasedness and Efficiency, Gauss Markov Theorem   
3. Hypothesis testing and Goodness of Fit   
4. Nested and nonnested Models   
##### Nonlinear models and Dummy Variables   
1. Nonlinearity in Variables, Quadratic, Cubic, Logarithmic and Interaction Terms   
2. Dummy Variables (can take value 0/1 or be categorical): slope and intercept, Dummy Variables trap   
3. Nonlinearity in parameters: introduction   
##### Heteroscadasticity, Autocorrelation, Multicollinearity   
> In this module, the assumptions made in the previous modules are relaxed and the following questions are asked:   
1. What if the variance of the error term is not constant?   
2. What if the covariance between the error terms of a regression is not zero?   
3. What if there is very high correlation between the independent variables?   
##### Omitted Variable, measurement errors and instrumental variables   
> Sometimes, there is lack of complete data. This module handles the questions that arise from handling missing data.   
1. What if we do not have data about some relevant control variables?   
2. If the measurement of a variable i not correct, how are the regression results affected in such cases?   
3. What if the error terms is correlated with independent variables?   
##### Binary response model, Sample selection problem   
- Until this module only continuous dependent variables are discussed. In this module variables can take discrete categorical values. This will be studied through Probit and Logit models.   
- In some other models, the dependent variable is continuous but a sizeable portion of the sample may take value zero, this can introduce some biasedness,  the methods to take care of a situation like that are also discussed in this module.   
## Readings   
This course is based on these two books:   
1. Introduction to Econometrics by Christopher Dougherty.   
2. Introductory Econometrics, a Modern Approach by Jeffery M Wooldridge. (Published by Cengage Learning, This covers more advanced material than Christopher Dougherty's book)
