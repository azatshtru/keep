A collection of modern utilities, written in and for ANSI C.
# Pillars
Simple, like C.
OS-agnostic
requires no other dependency other than the C compiler
fully ANSI C compatible
as explicit as possible while keeping ergonomics
# Components
- unit testing: orange juice
- asynchronous IO: AxIOm
- logging or benchmarking or mocking, I can't decide: lemonade
- randomness: xrandom
- vectors, strings, hashmap, priority queues, queues, and everything in between: common
- build system: makefile
- servers
